# The Higher Beings, Daemon Gods, The 'Filthy Farmers'
==========================================================================
* Refer to themselves as the Higher Beings, refer to the Lower Beings.
* Powerful, tries to keep magic away from mortals and just feeds off of the excess power generated. Sort of like if you had a nuclear power plant but no one was using it...
* Encourages technological advancement & religion simultaneously, relying on generating Faith to allow them to tap that nuclear power plant. In otherwords, the network of human religions works like their powergrid. It is a belief in a superior deity or deities that allows them to steal mortal magic to feed themselves. Instead of, y'know, eating people's souls.

# The Lower Beings, Daemon Gods, The 'Masters'
===========================================================================
* Considers themselves the Master Race, superior to the mortal races. Calls the Mortal Races the 'lower beings' which can leads to confusion with the label for them by the Higher Beings.
* Refers to themselves collectively as the Masters while their opposing force as the 'Filthy Farmers'.
* Relies on sacrifice and bloodshed to feed them souls. The end result is similar to the 'Farmer' method if they want to be efficient about it as it requires building a group of 'priest-slaves' to perform the sacrifices regularly and efficiently. Otherwise, they are relying on people dying from their Aspect.
