**Notes:**
This is Pathfinder based E8 that assumes players get 2 traits to work with.

Alignment can be +/- one step in any direction when specified.

HP represents the power imbued into the runes inscribed onto the flesh. Power fades as it absorbs damage. This also causes a 'cast from hitpoints' mechanic to some degree as HP represents magical power for all classes. Due to this, HP has been normalized to a d10. Cantrips are always free.

**Soul Pool**
A variety of Magi Archetypes allow a spellcaster to consume the soul of their victim and store it within themselves. This Pool works like soul stones but it is internal to the magi.

**The Pathes**
All Characters have a Civilian path and an Archetype path. The civilian paths are available to _any_ class. The Archetype path is limited to _that_ class.

**Skill Rename**
Knowledge: Local -> Knowledge: Civics [To avoid confusion]

# The Civilian Paths
========================================================================================================

### Artisan
 * Least - Pick any Craft and Profession skill. These are now craft skills with a number of ranks in them equal to your level. You gain enough from consignments of your work to cover the cost of food, a room at an inn, and replacing ruined clothes.
 * Moderate - You can craft magic items with your Craft skill as if you had the appropriate feat. You substitute your class level for your caster level. However, you may not create items that require spells you do not have access to. (e.g. Craft [Tattoo] would give Inscribe Magical Tattoo, Craft [Weaponsmith] would grant the ability to make magical weapons as if you had the Craft Magic Arms & Armor, Craft [Carpenter] would let you create wooden wondrous items)
 * Greater - You gain the Skill Focus feat in either your Craft or Profession skill. 
 * Capstone - You automatically succeed on UMD checks to use a scroll or wand to cast the spell required to craft items using your Moderate ability. In addition, you are treated as an 11th level Caster for purposes of crafting magical items using your Moderate ability. Once per adventure, you may craft an item without actually spending the time to craft it. It represents you pulling together your various tinkering to give you something you need. This tinkering ability does not function for a retainer.

### Aristocrat
 * Least - You gain Diplomacy, Bluff, Sense Motive, and Intimidate as Class Skills. In addition, you gain 1 additional skill rank at each level which must be placed into one of those four skills.  You gain enough from your investments to acquire a new potion containing a 1st level [e.g. Cure Light Wounds Potion] for every adventure in addition to maintaining a somewhat lavish lifestyle for yourself.
 * Moderate - You gain the Skill Focus feat in Diplomacy, Bluff, Sense Motive, or Intimidate.
 * Greater - You gain another Skill Focus feat in one of the relevant skills.
 * Capstone - You gain a loyal and valuable retainer [DM discretion] who helps you manage your affairs. This retainer will never betray you but may leave your service if mistreated. This retainer is a skilled Civilian who has access to up to the Greater Civilian Path abilities of any civilian path you choose. In addition, once the PC has exceeded the 8th level [gained 8+1 feats] the retainer gains access to the Capstone Civilian Path ability. This retainer also manages any financial investments and buisness you engage in as if he had the same skills as you, in addition to any skills the retainer already possesses.

### Peasent
 * Least - Gain +1 HP or +1 Skill Point at every level. Cannot be the same as your Favored Class choice.
 * Moderate - Gain any two skills as class skills.
 * Greater - Gain the Skill Focus in one of the skills you chose for your Moderate ability.
 * Capstone - Gain any feat as a bonus feat.

 * Moderate - Gain Skill Focus in any Knolwedge Skill.
 * Greater - Gain Skill Focus in any Knwledge Skill.
 * Capstone - You may always take 10 when using a Knowledge skill to discern a monster's abilities and weaknesses. In addition, you may spend a move action to consider your target to be 'studied' for purposes of Assassin Death attack type abilities, flat footed for purposes of sneak attacks, or any other ability that requires precise strikes on the target's anatomy.

## Warrior Archetypes

### The Ranger
**Least**: Master Tracker (Ex): A Ranger adds his HD to his Survival skill when following tracks and to the Survival DC to track him. 

Master of Nature (Ex): Whenever a ranger is in a rural area [at least a kilometer from the nearest population center that contains more than a hundred people], they gain a +2 to initiative, Perception, Stealth, Knowledge (Geography), and Survival skill checks. They also ignore penalties for moving through any natural undergrowth.

**Moderate**: Ranger's Precision (Ex): A Ranger chooses his blows carefully and adds a +2 to attack rolls and damage rolls as long as they have a discernable anatomy and he has at least one skill rank in a Knowledge skill that can be used to identify a creature of that type.

Swift Tracker (Ex): He also may track any creature he can identify with a Knowledge skill while moving at any speed without suffering penalties.

**Greater**: Pack Hunter (Ex): A Ranger is skilled in aiding his allies and any target he hits during a round grants his Ranger's Precision bonuses to his allies until his next attack. In addition, his bonus to attack and damage rolls doubles whenever his allies have hit the target since his last action.

**Capstone**: Master Hunter (Ex): A Ranger is skilled at ambushing his chosen prey. He is able to hide in any location where he recieves his Master of Nature bonus, even while being observed. However, he may not use this ability once combat has begun. In addition, he gains a sneak attack [like a rogue] of +5d6 on his first attack from hiding.


### The Paladin
*Requirements:* Alignment: Any Extreme Alignment [CG, LG, CE, LE]

**Least**: Channel Aligned Energy (Su): The Paladin is able to channel appropriately aligned energies a number of times of day equal to his 3+Cha mod as a swift action. Each time this ability is used it:
* Heals 1d6+Cha of HP to a chosen ally within 5' [touch spell/ability] as long as the ally's alignment partially matches the Paladin's alignment. [e.g. A LG Paladin can healy Any Good or Lawful]
* Adds his Cha modifier to Attack Rolls and Damage rolls for his attacks this round. If the target of any of these attacks is opposed to the Paladin's alignment on either Axis, you add the Warrior Level to the damage as well and bypass any non-AC defenses the target might have [e.g. Damage Reduction, Immunity to Critical Hits].

In addition, the Paladin generates an Aura for each part of his alignment [e.g. LE would generate a Lawful and an Evil aura] of a strength equal to his HD.

**Moderate**: Divine Grace (Su): The Paladin adds her Cha modifier (if positive) to all saving throws. 

In addition, they are able to cast spells as if they were a Magi of a quarter of their level [1st level spells at 4th level, 2nd level spells at 8th level, 3rd level spells with an Epic Spell feat]. A Paladin uses Cha for determining the DC of any spells she might cast. A Paladin's Caster Level is equal to half of their HD. A Paladin gains two _Spell Seeds_ from this ability and two _Signature Spells_. Unlike the average Magi, a Paladin's spellcasting powers will never grow beyond those initial spell seeds and signature spells. However, they may increase the power of their Signature Spells [spell level] as they gain access to new spellcasting levels.

**Greater**: Mercy (Su): A Paladin may remove any single status condition [e.g. Stunned, Staggered, Cursed] when using their Channel Aligned Energy ability to heal an ally.

In addition, they gain any combat feat as a Bonus Feat.

**Capstone**: Champion of the Faith (Su): Channeling Aligned Energy is now 6+Cha (instead of rolling) when used to heal allies. If you are opposed to the Paladin's alignment on either Axis, instead of bonus damage, the Channel Aligned Energy acts as a Death Effect [14+Cha, Fort negates]. If the target fails their save, they are turned to dust. If the target succeeds on their save, they take take the bonus damage and have their non-AC defenses bypassed as normal.

Larger-Than-Life (Ex): You do not take penalties to Intimidate checks due to your opponent being larger than you.

**Capstone**:
Run, Coward (Ex): Your demoralize actions now escalate the Fear condition and all opponents lose their immunity to fear for the duration of the encounter. [Shaken -> Frightened -> Panicked -> Cowering]

## Class Abilities

**Proficiencies**: The Magi is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. She does not suffer from arcane failure while in light armor.

**Spellcasting**: 
A Magi uses her spellbook [or spellbooks] to maintain her list of formulae, signature spells, and spell seeds. A Magi can acquire new spell seeds and signature spells through independent research or copying them from the spellbooks of others. Researching a new signature spell is relatively simple, requiring 1000gp and one week. A new spell seed is very, very difficult to research and the time and cost should be discussed with your DM. Normally, the best way to gain such is to acquire a spellbook from another Magi.

A Magi can only cast spell levels of up to half his class level, rounded up. Refer to Table: The Magi above.

A Magi's caster level is equal to their Class Level.

Please refer to the Spellbooks rules in Pathfinder for information on those.

**Focus**: 

The Magi must choose to focus on Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. This stat dicates the DC for the Magi's spells equal to [10 + Focus Stat Modifier + Spell Level].

* If Intelligence is chosen, all Knowledge skills are now Class Skills.
* If Charisma is chosen, you gain Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, and Use Magic Device to your Class Skills. You also gain an additional skill point with each level.
* If Wisdom is chosen, you gain Perception, Survival, and Heal as Class Skills. You may also use Disable Device on all classes of trap. You also gain an additional skill point with each level.

A Magi may add his Focus stat to the DC of spells cast via magic items she has crafted personally.

A Magi may maintain mastery of a number of _Signature Spells_ and _Spell Seeds_ equal to their focus modifier. A Magi may use her spellbook to swap out signature spells or spell seeds after spending a week of practice.

**Scribe Scroll**: All Magi gain Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat at 1st level.

**Civilian ()**: At 1st level, a Magi must choose a Civilian Specialty. This Specialty grants a new power at every odd level.

**Archetype ()**: At 2nd level, a Magi must choose an Archetype. This Archetype grants a new power at every even level. 


## Spell Seeds & Signature Spells

### Spell Levels
Each spell has an effective level based on how much power is inherent in a spell. Seeds and ways to augment the spell are listed by their effective spell level.

Each level of a spell consumes a single soul stone [worth 20gp, when charged via the standard mechanisms (e.g. stones you can buy on the street)] or part of a soul stored in such a stone. Souls are worth 1 spell level for every two HD.

### Casting on the Fly
A Magi can spend three rounds to weave a spell from the raw energies involved and use it to generate any magical effect available from his or her _Spell Seeds_. 

### Signature Spells
Signature Spells are spells a Magi has mastered to the point casting them is little more than a mental reflex [standard action]. This can be any spell he is capable from casting from a _Spell Seed_ he has mastered or it can be something more esoteric [basically, find a spell on a Druid, Sor/Wiz, or Cleric list from PF that you like].

### Spell Seeds

Each spell Seed represents the key _mechanical_ element of a spell. It should be re-flavored to fit the theme of the spellcaster. For instance the Fort Hex seed is basically saying 'Fort Save or Suffer A Penalty'. That is a little less fun than 'You feel weak as the necromancer drains your strength with his touch.' In addition, there are a number of formulae that are not mechanically restricted but do have an impact [such as the range of a spell].

Spell Seeds can have their effect increase by boosting their spell level. E.g. Save or Suck [Ranged Touch] +2 SL = Increases effect by 67% [1d2 -> 1d2+1] Avg goes from 1.5 -> 2.5)

Spell Seeds can be combined. E.g. Save or Suck [Shaken] + Save or Die [Will] = 5th level spell. Pass out from Fear, even if you succeed on your save you are Shaken for 1 rd.

__FORMULAE__
 * Time: You can quicken a spell [+4 spell levels]. You can lengthen the cast time [to one minute] to reduce the spell level by 1.
 * Range: For each range category, increase the spell level by .5 [e.g. Close = 0, Medium = .5, Long = 1]
 * Area: Add +1 spell levels to affect an additional opponent or add the equivalent of a 100' line or 20' burst to the spell's area of effect [or equivalent for different shapes].
 * Duration: If it is a long term spell [ buff] assume that the duration starts at 10 min / level and add 1 spell level per step you move it forward [1hr/CL +1, 1 day +2, permanent works with just a casting of Permanency via Epic Spell + 2,500gp per spell level]. Summons, Disabling, and anything that isn't 'damage offense' lasts 1 round per CL. HP damage is instaneous duration.

__SPELL SEEDS__
 * Save or Die [Fort] - Spell Level 3 - If the target fails their save, they drop to -1 hit points and start dying. 
 * Save or Die [Will] - Spell Level 3 - If the target fails their save, they are knocked unconcious. Alternatively, they are Frightened.
 * Save or Die [Ref] - Spell Level 3 - If the target fails their save, they are paralyzed. 
 * Save or Suck [Ranged Touch] - Spell Level 2 - Apply 1d2 negative level or applies a first tier condition [Shaken, Deafened, Entangled, or Fatigued]. 
 * Save or Suck [Fort] - As above.
 * Save or Suck [Ref] - As above.
 * Save or Suck [Will] - As above.
 * Damage [Fire] [Pick Target] - Spell Level 1 - Deal 5d6 damage to the target. Add 3d6 each time you increase the spell level. You can choose to apply this to any defense without needing a new seed.
 * Damage [Cold] [Pick Target] - As above
 * Damage [Acid] [Pick Target] - As above
 * Damage [Electricity] [Pick Target] - As above
 * Damage [Force] [Pick Target] - As above, except you use d4s instead of d6s.
 * Restore - Spell Level 1 - Heal 1d6+2 HP, add 1d6+2 for each additional spell level. Or you remove one tier of condition per spell level. Or one negative level. Or heal 3 points of ability damage.
 * Abjure - Spell Level 2 - Generate a shield vs a specific spell seed. e.g. Damage [Fire]. The next time the target is affected by a spell with that seed, the spell is negated. However, you must choose the seed when you cast the spell. This seed can be used to create generic dispels/counter spells as if it was Dispel Magic as well.
 * Conjure - Spell Level 1 - Summon a creature of a CR up to half the spell level. [e.g. boosting this to 2 is a CR 1]. Signature spells should summon one of a handful of thematic monsters.
 * Necromancy - Spell Level 5 [Take Epic Spell] - This is a powerful seed that allows you control over life and death. It allows you to bind souls into a soul stone as long as they are dying [-1 HP or less]. May want to ban this seed in some games as it allows unlimited spellcasting/wealth generation via murder.

__METAMAGIC__
 * Metamagic no longer applies. However, you can mitigate the increased cost of a Formulae using Traits that reduce metamagic costs. These only work for a single Formulae added to a single signature spell. E.g. Magical Lineage [Quicken Scorching Ray = 5th level instead of 6th] would reduce the effects of the Quicken formulae by 1 but have no other impact.

## Magi Archetypes

### Wytch
_Requirements:_ Alignment: Any Evil, Any Trait that increase Initative

**Least**: Gain Improved Initative as a Bonus Feat

**Moderate**: 
Unfettered (Ex): Wytches prioritize ruthelessly and fight free of any emotion. They are immune to any magic that causes emotions.

**Greater**: 
* Drain Life (Su): A Wytch gains a touch attack that deals a Negative Level to the target [Fort DC: 13+Focus, negates]. 

* Soulsteal (Su): The Wytch gains a number of points in their Soul Pool equal to the Negative Levels they inflict which they may spend on spells. This applies to any (Su) ability which inflicts negative levels [such as a Vampire's energy drain]. A Wytch can only have a number of points in this pool equal to their Caster Level.

**Capstone**: 
Bad Luck Hex (Su): As an immediate action, once per combat, a Wytch may force everyone affected by a single spell she casts once.

### Wytchfinder 
_Requirements:_ Alignment: Any Lawful, Skill Focus (Intimidate)

**Least**:
Gain Intimidate, Stealth, Sense Motive, and Disguise as Class Skills. If they are already class skills, gain 1 rank in the skill instead.

**Moderate**:
Tremble, Magi. (Ex): The first time an opponent casts a spell or uses a SLA, the Wytchfinder may make a demoralize attempt as an immediate action. This can only be used once per opponent per combat.

**Greater**:
Wytchfinder (Su): Wytchfinder can sense other Magi which have drained power from a victim [have points in their Soul Pool or charged Soul Stones with actual souls in them] in the last 24 hours. This is a constant visual effect that causes their target to radiate a white aura from their flesh or from the soul stones.

Harvester of Wytches (Su): Wytchfinders can drain power from an cowering, helpless [e.g. Helpless, Paralyzed, Asleep], or willing Magi. Any power stored in the Magi's soul pool is transfered from the target to the Wytchfinder.

**Capstone**: 
Tremble, Wytch (Ex): Spellcasters who have been demoralized [suffering from any fear condition] have the save DC of their spells reduced by the Wytchfinder's Focus modifer for the duration. In addition, Spellcasters are no longer immune to Fear generated by the Wytchfinder which allows a Wytchfinder to breach a Wytch's Unfettered ability.
